# Intro-To-Programming-Project-2017

// This program displays five circles on the screen that 'strobe' based on the volume of each synth voice. These voices form a chord together.
// Playback is the same for each voice exept that each voice has a different sequence length. This results in a phasing polyrhythmic piece similar to 'John Cage' or 'Steve Reich'.
// FFT is used to create a grid of waveforms as the background.
// This piece should run on its own upon pressing the mouse; no further user input is required.
// Open 'index' in Chrome to run application.
